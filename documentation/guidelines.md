# Identify core concepts:
- List the main entities and concepts in your problem domain
- Determine which should be classes or abstract data types

# Define relationships:
- Identify associations between classes (has-a, uses-a)
- Determine potential inheritance relationships (is-a)

# Apply design patterns:
- Consider common patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
- Use patterns that fit your specific needs

# Create a class diagram:
- Sketch out classes, their attributes, and methods
- Show relationships between classes

# Determine inheritance hierarchy:
- Identify common attributes and behaviors
- Create base classes and derived classes as appropriate
- Consider using interfaces (pure virtual classes in C++)

# Apply SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open/Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle

# Evaluate and refine:
- Review your design for cohesion and coupling
- Refactor if necessary to improve modularity

# Consider composition over inheritance:
- Use composition for more flexible designs
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies

# Plan for extensibility:
- Design with future changes in mind
- Use abstract classes and interfaces for flexibility
- 
# Document your design decisions:
- Explain the rationale behind your architecture
- This helps maintain the project long-term
